# Deployment and operations

[Documentation](README.en.md) · [简体中文](deployment.md) · **English**

Installation, upgrades, backups, and troubleshooting. See [development](development.en.md) for source builds and [quick start](../README.en.md#quick-start) for the first model request.

## Installation and startup

Download the matching artifact and `SHA256SUMS` from [Releases](https://github.com/PinkElysiaDev/Elysia-Api/releases/latest). Windows / Linux provide amd64 and arm64 binaries; macOS provides a universal DMG. Verify the downloaded file's SHA256 before launching it.

### Windows / Linux

Start from the download directory. This example uses Linux amd64:

```bash
chmod +x ./elysia-api-linux-amd64
./elysia-api-linux-amd64 --config ./config.json
```

On Windows use `.\elysia-api-windows-amd64.exe --config .\config.json`; on ARM64 use the matching arm64 filename.

- Without `--config`, the path is `config.json` in the **current working directory**, which is not necessarily the executable directory.
- A missing file is created automatically and a random panel token is printed to the startup log. A malformed file causes startup to fail without overwriting it.
- The default listener is `127.0.0.1:8765`. Standalone binaries report a port conflict instead of selecting another port.
- Open `/ui/` and sign in with the panel token. Rotate it after the first sign-in and protect the configuration and startup logs.
- Startup attempts to open a browser. Set `openBrowserOnStart: false` on headless hosts.

### macOS app

Drag ElysiaApi from the DMG into Applications. Requires macOS 12+ and supports Intel and Apple Silicon. Running and updating do not require Xcode.

| Action | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| First sign-in | Copy the panel token from the menu bar; credentials are not injected automatically |
| Data directory | `~/Library/Application Support/ElysiaApi/`, containing configuration, database, master key, and runtime log |
| Port conflict | Try the configured port, then an available port in `8799–8899`; use the address shown in the menu |
| Close window | Keep the service running; reopening retains authentication, position, and theme |
| Quit | Request graceful backend shutdown, then terminate the child if it times out |
| Recovery | Restart after sustained health failures; stop after 3 consecutive attempts and offer manual retry |
| Launch at login | Disabled by default; enabling it starts only the menu bar item at login |
| Notifications | Important notifications default to enabled; request system authorization on first use or explicit enable |
| Update | Download the DMG, verify digest, integrity, and signature; roll back a failed replacement; retain configuration and database |

The menu provides service controls, API address and token copying, logs, preferences, browser access, and update checks. The managed backend uses `ELYSIA_API_OPEN_BROWSER=false`. WebKit retains cookies and authentication after manual sign-in; signing out requires authentication again.

CI artifacts use ad-hoc signing, which is not Developer ID notarization. After verifying the file came from the project Release, a Gatekeeper block can be cleared with:

```bash
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/ElysiaApi.app
```

See [macOS validation](macos-testing.en.md) for detailed behavior and checks.

### Docker

Build the image from the repository root. Listen on `0.0.0.0` inside the container while binding the host port to loopback:

```bash
docker build -t elysia-api:local .
docker run -d --name elysia-api \
  --restart unless-stopped --init \
  --read-only --tmpfs /tmp:size=64m,mode=1777 \
  --security-opt no-new-privileges:true --cap-drop ALL \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8765:8765 \
  -e ELYSIA_API_HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -v elysia-data:/data \
  elysia-api:local
docker logs elysia-api
```

The image runs as UID/GID `65532` with `/data/config.json`. The named volume retains configuration, database, and keys. Bind-mounted directories must be writable by that user.

Alternatively, save this as `compose.yaml` in the repository root:

```yaml
services:
  elysia-api:
    build: .
    image: elysia-api:local
    container_name: elysia-api
    restart: unless-stopped
    init: true
    read_only: true
    tmpfs:
      - /tmp:size=64m,mode=1777
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    ports:
      - "127.0.0.1:8765:8765"
    environment:
      ELYSIA_API_HOST: 0.0.0.0
      ELYSIA_API_OPEN_BROWSER: "false"
    volumes:
      - elysia-data:/data
volumes:
  elysia-data:
```

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose logs elysia-api
```

Use a reverse proxy for TLS and external access; expose ports only to intended networks. If changing the internal port, also update the mapping and the image's health and shutdown probes, which use `8765`.

## Configuration

These are the main fields written on first launch. Replace the example token; do not deploy with `change-me`:

```json
{
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 8765,
  "panelAccessToken": "change-me",
  "databasePath": "elysia-api.sqlite3",
  "secretKeyPath": ".master-key",
  "logLevel": "info",
  "httpTimeout": 120,
  "openBrowserOnStart": true
}
```

| Field | Default and purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `host` / `port` | `127.0.0.1` / `8765`; restart to change the listener |
| `panelAccessToken` | Generated on first creation; protects management APIs, not inference |
| `databasePath` | `elysia-api.sqlite3`; models, tokens, sessions, and logs |
| `secretKeyPath` | `.master-key`; encryption key for sensitive SQLite fields |
| `logLevel` | `info`; accepts `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `httpTimeout` | 120 seconds in an automatically created config; explicit `0` or an omitted field means unlimited |
| `openBrowserOnStart` | Attempts to open a browser when omitted |
| `webuiDir` | Empty uses embedded assets; nonempty overrides the WebUI directory |
| `enablePprof` | `false`; enables admin-authenticated `/debug/pprof` routes; restart after changes |
| `maxBodyBytes` | `33554432` (32 MiB); request body limit |
| `debugMode` / `verboseLog` | Disabled by default; verbose logging requires both |

Relative `databasePath`, `secretKeyPath`, and `webuiDir` values resolve against the configuration directory. Model sources, groups, and API tokens are stored in SQLite through management APIs.

### Environment variables and precedence

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `ELYSIA_API_HOST` | Overrides the configured listener address on load and reload |
| `ELYSIA_API_OPEN_BROWSER` | Overrides browser startup without writing the file; an invalid boolean logs a warning and falls back |
| `ELYSIA_API_MASTER_KEY` | Takes precedence over key files; inject through a protected runtime environment |

Key lookup order: environment variable → `secretKeyPath` → legacy `.db-key` beside the database → generate a random key. Existing legacy keys remain in use so upgrades can decrypt stored values. Key creation failures produce warnings; a running service alone does not prove encryption was established.

### Runtime policies

| Block | Fields and defaults |
| --- | --- |
| `responses` | `enabled: true`, `upstreamMode: "auto"`; modes are `native`, `transform`, `auto` |
| `usage` | Estimate missing upstream usage by default; `charsPerToken: 4`, `defaultOutputTokenEstimate: 1024`, `imageInputTokenEstimate: 300`, `fileInputTokenEstimatePerKB: 128`; `estimateWhenMissing: false` disables estimation |
| `healthCheck` | Disabled by default; `intervalSeconds: 300`, `timeoutSeconds: 10`, `failureThreshold: 3`; probes may incur upstream charges |
| `modelCatalog` | models.dev enabled by default; bundled snapshot and local cache, mirror fallback on online failure; optional `url` and `proxy`; `syncIntervalMinutes` defaults to 1440, explicit `0` disables periodic sync |
| `agentRemote` | `enabled` defaults to `true`; `publicUrl` supplies the Agent Card address behind a reverse proxy; see [remote access](remote-agent-api.en.md) |
| `outbound` | Omitted `deniedIpRanges` uses private, loopback, and reserved ranges; explicit `[]` permits all ranges |

Local or private upstreams require an appropriate outbound-policy adjustment. Remove only the necessary CIDRs. Upstream access and model-catalog proxy settings are separate. See [config.json.example](../config.json.example) for the default deny list.

## Request logs

By default, logs contain metadata and usage, without request/response bodies, including for failed requests. Set `usageLog.bodyMaxKB` to a positive value to capture bodies; the WebUI initially enables it at 1024 KB. Automatic cleanup is disabled by default.

```json
{
  "usageLog": {
    "persistEnabled": true,
    "retentionDays": 0,
    "maxContentMB": 0,
    "maxRecords": 0,
    "bodyMaxKB": 0,
    "bodyOnErrorOnly": false,
    "externalizeMedia": true,
    "cleanupIntervalMinutes": 60
  }
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `persistEnabled` | Defaults to `true`; `false` stops request-log persistence |
| `retentionDays` / `maxRecords` | Age or record-count cleanup; `0` means unlimited |
| `maxContentMB` | request-log JSON plus deduplicated media content budget; `0` is unlimited; database pages are reclaimed independently |
| `bodyMaxKB` | KB limit for each of the four request-chain bodies; `0` disables body capture |
| `bodyOnErrorOnly` | Keep bodies only for failed requests; still requires `bodyMaxKB > 0` |
| `externalizeMedia` | Deduplicate base64 media under `usage-assets/` beside the database and retain placeholders in bodies |
| `cleanupIntervalMinutes` | Defaults to 60 minutes; positive values have a minimum of 5 |

Policies affect subsequent requests; old bodies are not retroactively removed. Retention cleanup preserves hourly aggregate statistics and deletes associated media. Explicit existing limits survive upgrades. Legacy keys are read only by the one-time migration and are not used at runtime.

`systemLog.retentionDays`, `systemLog.maxRecords`, and `systemLog.maxContentMB` independently limit system-log age, count, and content bytes; all default to `0` (unlimited). The request-log budget excludes system logs, usage aggregates, model configuration, and Agent sessions. A content budget is not a hard disk limit for the SQLite file: indexes, free pages, and WAL are reported separately. The first upgrade retains `.pre-log-lifecycle` database and configuration backups in the data directory; they are not deleted automatically. Retention keeps historical usage aggregates, while Reset Usage clears them.

## Process supervision

Standalone binaries are long-running processes. Use systemd, a Windows service wrapper, or a container. This unit assumes a system user named `elysia`, a binary under `/opt/elysia-api/`, and writable configuration and data directories for that user:

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Elysia API
After=network.target

[Service]
User=elysia
WorkingDirectory=/opt/elysia-api
ExecStart=/opt/elysia-api/elysia-api-linux-amd64 --config /opt/elysia-api/config.json
Environment=ELYSIA_API_OPEN_BROWSER=false
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Save it as `/etc/systemd/system/elysia-api.service`, then run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` and `sudo systemctl enable --now elysia-api`. Inspect startup logs with `journalctl -u elysia-api`.

## Upgrades, backup, and restore

SQLite uses WAL, a 5000 ms busy timeout, foreign keys, and `synchronous=NORMAL`.

1. Stop the service before upgrading. Back up `config.json`, the database and any remaining `-wal` / `-shm` files, and `usage-assets/`.
2. Protect and back up the active encryption key separately. If supplied by an environment variable, preserve its secure recovery procedure. Leaking both database and key defeats encryption at rest.
3. Retain the old binary, replace the binary or image, and start with the existing configuration and data.
4. Check `/health`, panel sign-in, the model list, and an inference request. Real inference incurs upstream charges.
5. To restore, stop the service, restore matching configuration, database, media, and key from the same backup, restore permissions, then start a compatible version. Do not replace only the main database file or generate a new key.

For online backups, use SQLite backup tooling to obtain a consistent database and coordinate the media snapshot. Do not copy only the main file while it is being written. An unwritable data directory or full disk causes writes to fail.

## Token recovery

If the panel token is lost, stop the service, set `panelAccessToken` to a new random value, restart, and sign in again. Relay tokens reside in SQLite; change them through the panel after restoring access.

## Reloading

`POST /api/admin/reload` requires panel authentication. See the [API reference](webui-api.en.md#runtime-config) for runtime updates. Listener address, port, database path, and pprof route changes require a restart; reloading does not recreate these resources.

`POST /__reload` and `POST /__shutdown` accept only loopback callers. Do not expose them through a reverse proxy.

## Legacy migration

- `server.host` / `server.port` are fallback values only when the corresponding top-level fields are absent.
- Current configuration parsing no longer reads `tokens` or `modelGroups`, or treats `dashboardToken` as the panel token. Do not rely on automatic migration described in older documentation. Export through a compatible older release or recreate data through management APIs, keeping the original backup.
- Startup migration processes the deprecated `customProtocols` field and removes it from configuration. Back up first and inspect the result in the protocol designer after startup.
- See [Maheshvara](maheshvara-protocol.en.md) and [protocol definitions](protocol-definition-reference.en.md) for model capabilities, streaming, and custom-protocol constraints.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Check |
| --- | --- |
| Connection refused | Service log, actual port; Docker must set `ELYSIA_API_HOST=0.0.0.0` |
| Panel returns 401 | Use the panel token and verify the config path; relay and Agent keys are different credentials |
| Upstream connection blocked | Outbound CIDRs, resolved IP addresses, and proxy settings |
| Logs have no bodies | A positive `bodyMaxKB` enables future capture; old requests cannot be captured retroactively |
| Secrets cannot be decrypted after upgrade | Original master key or legacy `.db-key`; changed environment variables |
| Empty model list | Upstream discovery endpoint, per-key permissions, and the custom protocol's `models` definition |
