## Conventions

- Documentation describes the checked-out revision. Use the corresponding Git tag for older releases.
- Original paths contain Chinese; `.en.md` contains English. Field names, commands, endpoints, and protocol identifiers remain unchanged.
- Angle-bracket values such as `<RELAY_TOKEN>` are placeholders. Structures containing ellipses are labeled as illustrative fragments.
- Panel tokens, relay tokens, and Agent keys serve different purposes. See [authentication](remote-agent-api.en.md#authentication).
- Resolve discrepancies against routes, types, configuration loaders, and tests. See [documentation maintenance](development.en.md#documentation-maintenance).
